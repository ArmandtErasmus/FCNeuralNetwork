# Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNeuralNetwork) in Python

The aim of this project is to create a feed forward neural network in python that has fully connected layers. A feed forward neural network is a network in which there is no recurrent interaction between the output and input neurons. Furthermore, a neural network is said to be fully connected when every neuron in a layer is connected to every other neuron in the preceding layer.

A basic neural network architecture, with a row vector $X$ as the input layer and a row vector $Y$ as the output layer, is shown below

$X$ $\longrightarrow$ Hidden Layers $\longrightarrow$ $Y$

The row vector $X$ contains the data that we wish to feed through the neural network. In general $X\in\mathbb{R^{i}}$
